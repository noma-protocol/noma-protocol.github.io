Facilitates the staking and unstaking of NOMA tokens, converting them into sNOMA tokens that represent ownership in the staked NOMA pool. sNOMA is a rebasing asset, adjusting its supply to reflect changes in the total staked NOMA amount. This mechanism ensures that stakers maintain a proportional share of the staked pool over time, relative to their initial stake.

## Features

- **Stake Function**: Transfers NOMA tokens to the contract and mints equivalent sNOMA tokens for the staker.
- **Unstake Function**: Burns sNOMA tokens to release the staker's NOMA tokens from the contract.
- **Reward Notification**: Only the vault can notify the contract of rewards to distribute. Rewards are distributed based on the current epoch's rules, with adjustments to sNOMA token supply via rebasing.

## Components

- **NOMA**: The ERC-20 token used for staking.
- **sNOMA**: An interface managing sNOMA tokens, which rebase to reflect changes in staked NOMA.
- **Epochs**: Each epoch tracks a period during which rewards are distributed and adjusts the supply of sNOMA tokens.
- **Vault**: The address from which rewards are distributed and epoch changes are triggered.

## Structure and Dependencies

- **SafeERC20**: Used for safe interactions with ERC20 tokens.
- **IERC20**: Interface for ERC20 token operations.
- **IsNomaToken**: Interface for sNOMA token operations.
