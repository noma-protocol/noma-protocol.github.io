The Noma protocol's credit facility is an innovative financial service designed to provide users with capital efficiency and stability. It leverages the protocol's ETH reserves to issue loans backed by $NOMA collateral at the floor price. This section delves into the technical architecture, mechanisms, and operations of the credit facility, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its functionality and benefits.

## Overview
### Collateralization

- **Collateral Asset:** $NOMA
- **Collateral Value:** Collateral is valued at the floor price at the time of loan issuance
- **Locking Mechanism:** Asets are locked for the duration of the loan

### Loan Issuance

- **Loan Amount:** Determined as a percentage of the collateral's value at the floor price
- **Service Fee:** An upfront fee is charged, calculated as a percentage of the loan amount
- **Duration:** Loans have a predefined expiry date, after which the collateral is burned

## Smart Contract Logic

### Loan Contract Creation:
A new loan contract is instantiated upon successful collateralization and payment of the service fee.
State Variables:
- `collateralAmount`: The amount of $NOMA collateralized.
- `loanAmount`: The amount of ETH loaned.
- `expiryDate`: The date when the loan expires.
- `serviceFee`: The upfront fee paid by the user.

### Functions:
- `collateralize(uint256 _amount)`: Locks $NOMA and initializes the loan contract.
- `repayLoan()`: Allows users to repay the loan and retrieve their collateral.
- `burnCollateral()`: Burns the collateral if the loan is not repaid by the expiry date.


## Risk Management

### No Liquidation Risk:
Unlike traditional loans, Noma's credit facility does not involve liquidation. If the loan is not repaid by the expiry date, the collateral is burned.

## Economic Model

### Capital Efficiency

#### 100% Capital Efficiency:
Loans are issued at full collateral value (minus service fee), providing maximum capital efficiency for users.
#### Service Fee Dynamics:
The service fee is designed to compensate the protocol for the risk and to maintain operational sustainability.
#### Fee Structure:
`serviceFee = loanAmount * feePercentage` \
The fee percentage is adjustable based on protocol governance or algorithmic determination.

## Protocol-Owned Liquidity (POL) Interaction

### ETH Reserves:
The protocol uses its ETH reserves to issue loans, ensuring sufficient liquidity at all times.
### Revenue Generation:
Fees collected from the credit facility contribute to the protocolâ€™s revenue.
