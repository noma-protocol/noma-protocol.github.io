The Noma protocol's credit facility is an innovative financial service designed to provide users with capital efficiency and stability. It leverages the protocol's ETH reserves to issue loans backed by $NOMA collateral at the floor price. This section delves into the technical architecture, mechanisms, and operations of the credit facility, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of its functionality and benefits.

## Overview
- **100% Capital Efficiency:** \
Loans are emitted with full collateral value at floor price minus service fee
- **Paid Upfront:** \
An upfront fee is charged, based on the loan amount and duration
- **No Liquidations:** \
If the loan is not repaid by the expiry date, the collateral is burned
- **Duration:** \
Loans have a predefined expiry date set by the borrower
- **Fee Structure:** \
The fee percentage is adjustable based on protocol governance

## Contract Logic
A new loan contract is instantiated upon successful collateralization and payment of the service fee.
### State Variables:
- `collateralAmount` The amount of $NOMA collateralized.
- `loanAmount` The amount of ETH loaned.
- `expiryDate` The date when the loan expires.
- `serviceFee` The upfront fee paid by the user.

### Functions:
- `collateralize(uint256 _amount)`: Locks $NOMA and initializes the loan contract
- `repayLoan()`: Allows users to repay the loan and retrieve their collateral
- `burnCollateral()`: Burns the collateral if the loan is not repaid by the expiry date
