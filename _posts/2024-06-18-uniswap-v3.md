Uniswap V3 is a major upgrade to the decentralized exchange protocol, enhancing liquidity provision with concentrated liquidity positions. Unlike its predecessor, V3 allows liquidity providers (LPs) to focus their funds within specific price ranges or "ticks," optimizing capital efficiency and potentially reducing impermanent loss. It introduces multiple fee tiers (0.05%, 0.3%, and 1%), offering LPs flexibility in choosing risk-reward ratios. Each liquidity position is represented as an ERC-721 NFT, enabling LPs to manage positions individually. This upgrade aims to improve trading efficiency, reduce slippage, and integrate more seamlessly with oracles and DeFi protocols, positioning Uniswap V3 at the forefront of decentralized finance innovation.
