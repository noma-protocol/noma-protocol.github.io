Noma is an advanced Automated Liquidity Management (ALM) system built on Uniswap V3, designed to manage and optimize its treasury using concentrated liquidity positions trustlessly with built-in market making.

- **Noma's Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL):**
ensures stability through ETH-backed floor positions, dynamic price discovery with $NOMA, and broad liquidity coverage via anchor positions.

- **Credit facility:**
offers capital-efficient loans with $NOMA collateral, avoiding liquidation risk by burning unpaid collateral.

- **Staking and trading rewards:**
provide $NOMA rewards, encouraging user participation and engagement.

- **Liquidity rebalancing:**
through the sweep() function maintains optimal reserve distribution and increases the Baseline Liquidity Value (BLV).

- **Revenue streams:**
include liquidity provision fees and upfront service fees from loans, with strategic revenue reinvestment for stability and ongoing development.

Nomaâ€™s design ensures a robust and sustainable ALM system in the decentralized finance space.
