Protocol owned liquidity (POL) refers to the liquidity that is directly controlled and managed by the Noma protocol itself. Unlike traditional decentralized finance (DeFi) systems that rely solely on user-provided liquidity, POL ensures that the protocol has a substantial and stable liquidity reserve, enhancing its resilience and operational integrity.

## Revenue Stream
The Noma protocol generates revenue through multiple channels, each contributing to the protocolâ€™s financial health and long-term sustainability:

### Liquidity Provisioning
- **Mechanism:** \
The protocol earns fees by providing liquidity on Uniswap V3.
- **Impact:** \
Ensures a steady flow of income from trading fees, enhancing the protocol's liquidity reserves.

### Credit Facility
- **Mechanism:** \
Users can take out loans by collateralizing their $NOMA tokens at the floor price. A non-recurring service fee is charged upfront.
- **Impact:** \
Generates revenue from loan fees while maintaining 100% capital efficiency. Loans are secured by the protocol's ETH reserves, with no risk of liquidation but with collateral burning if not repaid.

## Liquidity Rebalancing Fees
- **Impact:**\
The protocol reallocates reserves from the discovery position to the floor and anchor positions whenever the sweep() function is executed.
- **Mechanism:** \
These reallocated reserves contribute towards increasing the Baseline Liquidity Value (BLV) of the protocol.
