## Liquidity Rebalances: `sweep()`, `slide()`, and `bump()`

Baseline protocol incorporates three advanced liquidity rebalancing strategiesâ€”`sweep()`, `slide()`, and `bump()`â€”designed to optimize liquidity management based on NOMA token market dynamics.

- `sweep`: Triggered upon a 2% decrease in NOMA token price.
- `slide`: Triggered upon a 2% decrease in NOMA token price.
- `bump`: Triggered upon sufficient accumulation of liquidity surplus.

### `sweep()`

**Functionality:**
- **Liquidity Redistribution:** Moves liquidity from lower anchor ranges to the floor, enhancing its capacity to sustain higher market prices.
- **Surplus Deployment:** Redistributes excess liquidity across anchor ranges, bolstering liquidity depth near actively traded price levels.
- **Expansion of Discovery Range:** Increases liquidity capacity in the discovery range, enhancing overall market liquidity.

### `slide()`

**Functionality:**
- **Liquidity Adjustment:** Repositions anchor liquidity closer to the current NOMA price, maximizing absorbable liquidity capacity.
- **Depth Reduction in Discovery Range:** Lowers liquidity thresholds in the discovery range, facilitating quicker market responses to price declines.

### `bump()`

**Functionality:**
- **Price Impact Strategy:** Attempts to elevate the NOMA Base Liquidity Value (BLV) by assessing the feasibility of buying back circulating tokens at higher prices.
